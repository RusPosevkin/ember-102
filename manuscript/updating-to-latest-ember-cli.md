# Updating your project to the latest version of ember-cli

Ember CLI is a project that is still moving quickly, so from time
to time we'll need to update our applications to use the latest
version.

The best way to upgrade is to follow the release notes, which the core
team adds with every release.

If we look at the following release
[https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/releases/tag/v2.7.0-beta.4](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/releases/tag/v2.7.0-beta.4),
we'll find notes about the commands that we need to run, notable
deprecation's, and links to an example project called
[ember-new-output](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-new-output/compare/v2.7.0-beta.3...v2.7.0-beta.4)
which shows the changes after upgrading a project.

## Wrapping up.

Ember can have a tough learning curve, but after getting the basics,
you'll see that the time invested in learning will pay off. Not only
it will make your more productive, but you'll be able to take
advantage of its addon ecosystem and all the good stuff happening in
the JavaScript world. As Yehuda Katz said during Ember Conf 2016:
Eventually all the good ideas will end up in Ember.

Learning Ember today is very different to the time when this book was
first published. We have an official "Learning team", they are doing a
terrific job keeping the
[guides up to date](https://guides.emberjs.com) and making sure that
every new feature is documented for mainstream adoption.

If you are asking yourself were to go next, my recommendation would be
start building applications, since that will be the only way to get
real world experience. I'll try to update the book as new features arrive
and let you know what has changed in the release notes. You can also
follow me on twitter [abuiles](https://twitter.com/abuiles) for
updates.

Lastly, if you enjoy this book and want to support my work, you can do
so buying my other book

or if you download this book for free and think it was worth
something, you can send me donations

Happy learning!
